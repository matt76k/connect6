# Connect6 competition

## Game Rules

  The rules of Connect6 are very simple and as follows

  - Players and stones: There are two players.
    The first player, called Black here, holds a set of black stones.
    The second player, called White here, holds a set of white stones.

  - Board: In theory, the size of game board can be infinite.
    We use 19x19 Go Boards.

  - Moves:  Black plays first and puts only one black stone on one unoccupied grids.
    Subsequently, Black and White alternately put two of their own stones on two unoccupied grids.

  - Winning: The one who first gets six or more consecutive stones (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) of her/his own wins.
    When all grids on the board are placed without connecting six, the game draws.
